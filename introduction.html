    <ul class="qa_question">
      <li>Personal Background:</li>
        <ul class="qa_answer">
          <li>I'm 28 years old and originally from Conover, NC. I have lived in Charlotte for almost 7 years
            now (sheesh), and I live north of the city. SO and I really enjoy traveling/adventuring, food,
            and hanging out with our puppers and cats. He runs a record label (Refresh Records if you want
            to buy some music Cool), so pre-COVID, you'd often find us at a show or packing orders. I've
            been getting more into baking and bookmaking....and Animal Crossing...and likely Stardew Valley
            soon. I've also recently been picking up cycling (used to try to run, but my knees were getting
            angry with me). I'm a big fan of the Reply All podcast as well as several McElroy Family
            podcasts.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Professional Background:</li>
        <ul class="qa_answer">
          <li>I've worked in restaurants, a hotel, and retail, but for the last 6ish years, I've worked at a
            Managed Services Provider (MSP) based in South Charlotte. We provide network and security management
            and monitoring to a pretty wide array of corporations and handle a variety of technologies. I
            started as an entry level technician (lots of helping food service/retail employees find their
            routers and walking them through layer 1 troubleshooting) and worked my way up through the NOC
            (handling issues with more complex functions and networks), then out of the NOC. There, I've been a
            process manager, a project manager, a service manager, and I've been the director of Service
            Management for a little over 2 years now.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Academic Background:</li>
        <ul class="qa_answer">
          <li>I started my academic career at LRU as a high school scholar, then I attended Appalachian for a
            couple of years in pursuit, initially, of a pre-professional microbiology degree, then I switched to
            nursing, which led me to Queens. At Queens, I became drawn to their Psychology program (their
            professors are A++) and ended up switching my minor (Psychology) to my major and graduating in 2015
            with a BA in Psychology and a minor in Human Biology. I'd always intended to return to school for
            nursing, but the costs (monetary and otherwise) of living and working have gotten in the way as they
            stereotypically do. I started fiddling around with learning various elements of programming years
            ago and found a way to kinda sorta work that sort of activity into part of my job. I recently
            realized how much I enjoy the process and seeing the finished (is anything ever finished, though?)
            product come to life. That and seeing the worklife my SO has (he's a software architect) has
            compelled me to try to break into the field, so here I am!</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Primary Computer Platform:</li>
        <ul class="qa_answer">
          <li>Mac, OSX Catalina, 10.15.4</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Courses I'm taking, and why:</li>
        <ul class="qa_answer">
          <li>WEB110_85 - This class is part of my program. I'm only taking this class this Summer so I can focus
            more fully on learning and not burn myself out and also continue to do my day job. I took nearly a
            full load last semester (with multiple short session classes), which, in retrospect, was a bit much.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Funny Story to remember me by:</li>
        <ul class="qa_answer">
          <li>I am a graduate of the Domino's Pizza Prep School in Ann Arbor, MI, and I was given a golden spoodle
            for a token of my completion. My class set the record for selling the entire stock of lava cakes at
            their HQ store. I made a sellable pizza in about a minute, and I watched someone make a sellable
            pizza in a little more than that with a blindfold on.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>I'd also like to share:</li>
