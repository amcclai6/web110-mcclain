<h2>Q+A</h2>

<ol class=qa_question>
  <li>What is the purpose of the site?</li>
    <ul class="qa_answer">
      <li class="nobullet">The purpose of the site is not to further contribute to the sometimes vapid blog/lifestyle but rather to
        provide an honest account of the experiences had in various locations, with an emphasis on the culture and interactions
        with people. From a food perspective, this would mostly be quick blurbs about favorite things both made at home
        and eaten at restaurants with elements of history worked in.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li>What do you want the website to accomplish?</li>
    <ul class="qa_answer">
      <li>In terms of travel bits, I'd want it to encourage people to, instead of visiting places to rack up stamps in
        their passports or reasons to post on Instagram, to travel to really connect with the people, history, and culture
        of the places they visit. People miss so much when they stick to whatever is most popular or never leave a resort.
      </li>
      <li>In terms of food, I'd want it to encourage people to have more confidence in themselves when they're in the
        kitchen, to show them that it's okay to make mistakes. Everyone makes them, and sometimes they turn out tasty. Selfishly,
        I'd also like it to be a pretty virtual recipe box for <em>my</em> recipes. I have a ton saved in various apps, but none
        are really mine.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li>What opportunity, problem, or issue is your site addressing?</li>
    <ul class="qa_answer">
      <li class="nobullet">Regarding the travel portion, I'd hope it would address issues of travellers: only being physically
        present at their destination, missing out on rewarding experiences, and not being aware of travel's impact on
        our climate. Regarding the food portion, I think I sort of answered this in the previous bullet, but so many
        people think they can't cook or that they can't make things they'd pay more for at a restaurant at home. I started trying
        to replicate some of my favorite restaurant meals at home, particularly in times where I couldn't really afford to eat out,
        and most of the time, I was pleasantly surprised! That's not to say that I didn't run into meals that ended up not being 
        practical to make at home regularly or that needed special equipment/ingredients that I couldn't justify buying. I also
        ran into dishes that I havent (yet) been able to get quite <em>there</em> yet, but on the whole, 9/10, do not regret.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li>Who is your intended audience? Be specific.</li>
    <ul class="qa_answer">
      <li class="nobullet">I anticipate my target audience would primarily be women in the 19-38 (Gen Y/Millennial) age range, but I'd hope
        there would be other readers peppered in there as well. 
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li>What type of content might be included in your site? Be specific.</li>
    <ul class="qa_answer">
      <li class="nobullet">The primary content, for the food portion, would be recipes, which would include photos, recipe cards, and nutritional 
        information (ported from somewhere like VeryWell Health). It'd also likely include links to relevant favorite recipes, 
        restaurants, and tools. The primary content for the travel portion would be blogs that would include photos, links to 
        favorite places, facts, and anecdotes about the location and my experiences.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li>List at least two related or similar sites found on the Web.</li>
    <ul class="qa_answer">
      <li><a href="https://anywhereweroam.com/blog/">Anywhere We Roam</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://iamafoodblog.com/">i am a food blog</a></li>
